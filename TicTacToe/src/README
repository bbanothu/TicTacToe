I used eclipse to run my project by executing the Main.java
TicTacToe.java, blank.jpg, o.jpg, and x.jpg are required in order for the program to operate
Project structure for Eclipse is:
	src/application/Main.java
	src/application/TicTacToe.java
	src/o.jpg
	src/x.jpg
	srx/blank.jpg
	
Side note the argument string we were told to add to eclipse during the lab broke my project/any javaFX I attempted to run.
It would give a JVM error and not execute.

String in question: "--module-path=path-to-javafx-skd/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls"
